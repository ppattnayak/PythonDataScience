### Homework 2: Financial Statement Analysis
Q. You are a Data Scientist working for a consulting firm. One of your
colleagues from the Auditing department has asked you to help them assess the
financial statement of organisation X.
You have been supplied with two vectors of data: monthly revenue and monthly
expenses for the financial year in question. Your task is to calculate the following
financial metrics:
- profit for each month
- profit after tax for each month (the tax rate is 30%)
- profit margin for each month - equals to profit after tax divided by revenue
- good months - where the profit after tax was greater than the mean for the year
- bad months - where the profit after tax was less than the mean for the year
- the best month - where the profit after tax was max for the year
- the worst month - where the profit after tax was min for the year

• Free Throws
• Free Throw Attempts
You need to create three plots that portray the following insights:
• Free Throw Attempts per game
• Accuracy of Free Throws
• Player playing style (2 vs 3 points preference) excluding Free Throws*
*Each Free Throw is worth 1 point

### Homework 4: World Life Expectancy and Fertility Rate Trends
Q. The world bank was very impressed with your deliverables on the previous assignment and they have a new project for you.

You are required to produce a scatterplot depicting Life Expectancy (y-axis) and Fertility Rate (x-axis) statistics by Country.
The scatterplot need to be categorised by Countries Regions.
You have been supplied with data for 2 years: 1960 and 2013 and you are requires to produce a visualisation for each of these years.
Some data has been provided in a CSV file, some in Python lists. The CSV file contains combined data for both years. 
All data manipulations have to be performed in Python (not in Excel) because this project can be audited at the later stage.
You also have been requested to provide insights into how the two periods compare.
